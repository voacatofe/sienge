			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Project Repository and Version Control",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down repository initialization into: (1) Git repository creation, (2) .gitignore configuration for all relevant artifacts, (3) README.md setup, (4) Husky pre-commit hook configuration for linting/formatting.",
			"reasoning": "This task is foundational and follows well-established patterns. Each step is straightforward but should be separated for clarity and traceability, especially with Husky integration and .gitignore customization."

			"taskTitle": "Set Up Next.js 13+ Project with App Router",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Split into: (1) Project bootstrapping with TypeScript, (2) App Router enablement, (3) Dockerfile for deployment, (4) Environment variable management, (5) Tailwind CSS and React Context integration.",
			"reasoning": "While Next.js setup is standardized, combining containerization, environment management, and state/styling integration increases the implementation surface."

			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Expose PostgreSQL for External BI Tools Securely",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) Port exposure in Compose, (2) Credential documentation, (3) Network/firewall restriction, (4) SSL enablement, (5) External client testing and concurrency validation.",
			"reasoning": "Secure exposure of a database involves network, credential, and encryption configuration, plus validation with external tools and concurrency support."
